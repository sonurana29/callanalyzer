Hmm, I believe I have it here somewhere. Where did I put it again? Is it here? Oh, gotcha! I give them a call now. Great, have a nice day. Thank you for calling Jasween's Hair Studio. This is Andrew. How can I help you? Hello there. I'd like to schedule an appointment using my lovely gift voucher that my friend gave me. Can you help me? Yes, I can assist you with your concern. When is your preferred appointment? Do you have a schedule free for weekend? This weekend? Let me check your calendar for you, okay? What time would you like the book? I think maybe I'll have it late in the afternoon because I wake up late during the weekend. I see. We only have two spots free on Saturday afternoon. That would be at 1pm and 3pm. Oh, hmm, it's a little tricky because I'm meeting with a friend at 1pm in the afternoon at the Aberdeen Dale and it will take around 30 minutes for me to get to your hair salon and you know the stories and all it can take because it's a decade. How about like 5pm? Well, our 5pm is actually booked for Saturday. Would you like an evening appointment instead? We have 6pm and 7pm available for you. Oh, I'll get the 6pm. Alright, what service would you like to get? I think just a haircut. I have a $100 voucher here which I believe is just enough for a haircut. Alright, well, Lacey, you might be interested in our promo that will run for the entire month of December for Jasmine's Hair Studios' 10th year anniversary celebration. Interesting. What's your promo, by the way? Alright, when you get our hair color services which cost $125, you will get a free haircut and since you already have a $100 gift voucher, you'll only have to add $25 more. Wow, that's great. I'll get that. I'm thinking of changing my hair color anyway. Alright, that's nice to hear. Can I have your phone number, please? Sure. It's 917-753-8170. May I also get the spelling of your name, please? Alright, it's Mildred. M-I-L-D-R-E-D. And my last name is Anderson. A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N. Alright, thank you. And what's your email address? I don't really have an email that's on my phone. Will you use it for the appointment? Yes, we'll use it to send confirmation regarding your appointment. It's just my name actually. It's Mildred underscore Anderson at hashmail.com. Alright, and can I also have the barcode number, please? I'm sorry? The barcode number on the back of the voucher? Oh yeah, the barcode number. Well, this number is starting with 1000. Yes, exactly. Alright, so 1000 followed by 13378-4245. Alright, thanks Mildred. One moment please while I set up the appointment for you, okay? No problem. Alright. So Mildred, I successfully created an appointment for you. You will get a hair collar with a free haircut this coming Saturday at 6 o'clock in the evening. Please expect the confirmation email at Mildred underscore Anderson at hashmail.com within 30 minutes after this call. Is there anything else I can help you with? That's all, thanks. Alright, thank you for calling and have a wonderful day. You too."

Oh yes, I bought a coat from you guys but I need to return it because it was the wrong size and my size is not available. I haven't received any email from you and I wonder if my payment has been refunded. Seems like it does not apply on my account yet. I do apologize for the inconvenience but let me go ahead and check if there are some notes in the order details. May I ask for the original online order number? Okay, let me see. Please wait for a moment. Okay I believe it's 017-1425-793. Thank you. Just to verify that 017-1425-793, correct? Yes, that's right. I do apologize but the one that you provided is actually not accepting towards our database. Do you actually have a number that starts with 0007 or 7? Or can I ask for your first and last name so I can manually check it in our database? Yeah, I'm not sure about a 000 something. Anyway it's Adam Wilson. Alright, thank you. So Wilson is spelled as W for Whiskey, I for India, L for Lima, S for Sierra, O for Oscar and for November. Is that correct Adam? Yes. Alright, thank you for that information. Okay let me just quickly log into a portal and check any notes in your order. Do you still have the return tracking from the courier company when you return the item? Not sure. Is it the 74391? That's actually the return authorization from coats and gowns. When you return the item to the courier company for shipping, they should have provided you with the return tracking. Do you still have that? It's actually printed in the upper right part of the receipt. Okay, I probably have to dig it up. Okay, I imagine I have it somewhere but it might take some time to look for that. Oh, I see. Anyway I tried to search for your name and nothing is coming up. Can I ask for the order under your name originally? Yeah, yeah it's under my name. So it's not under Andy or something? It's Adam? Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Now what's the phone number that you put in the order before? Okay probably it's 411-345-0377. Thank you. It's 411-345-0377, is that correct? Oh, it's 0377. Okay and what's the email address that you gave when you fill out the order form? Okay that should be adam underscore wilson at mailfence.com. Thank you. So again it's adam underscore wilson at mailfence.com, is that correct? Yes it is. Thank you. So, adam underscore wilson at mailfence.com. Okay thank you. Now I just want to make sure that I have the correct details. Please hold on for a moment. We'll check on the details here in my end, okay? Oh sure no problem. Alright. Okay thank you for patiently waiting Adam. Now I can actually see here that you have called to inform us that you'd like to return the item on the 15th of November. Is that correct? Yes. Now did you return the item to the courier company on the same day that you called? Probably close to it. I'm not really sure if it's on the same day though but probably just close to that day. I understand. However, upon checking the date that you actually called in for the return, it's already beyond the timeframe that we ask for refunds. So what we'll do is I'll go ahead and forward this information to our corporate office and I'll have them check and update you directly about the refund. So please expect an email within 2-4 business days. Is that okay with you? 2-4 business days? Yes. No worries. We'll send it to them right now. Oh really? Okay. Alright. At first I thought that it will probably be like 3-5 weeks to process. Oh no no no. Don't worry Adam. It's only 2-4 business days. So you already checked your account and nothing has been credited yet on the card ending in 7-5-3? Is that right? Oh nothing yet. Okay I understand. And I'll go ahead and forward them the details that I have here. So I'll send the email to adam.wilson.mailfence.com correct? Yes that's right. Alright. Thank you so much for that information Adam. I will be forwarding this over to our corporate office now and thank you again for calling Coats and Gowns. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Oh no that's all. Thank you. You're welcome. And my pleasure. Have a nice day. Bye. Alright. Thank you."

I located your information. The newest version we have available for your vehicle is version 7.7, which was released in March of 2012. The price of the new map is $99 plus shipping and tax. Let me go ahead and set up this order for you. Well, can we wait just a second? I'm not really sure if I can afford it right now. All right. Well, here are a few reasons to consider purchasing today. It looks as though you haven't updated your vehicle for three years. So that would be the equivalent of getting three years' worth of updates for the price of one. Oh, okay. In addition, special offers like the current promotion don't come around too often. I would definitely recommend taking advantage of the extra $50 off before it expires. Yeah, that does sound pretty good. If I set this order up for you now, it'll ship out today and for $50 less. Do you have your credit card handy? And I can place this order for you now. Yeah, let's go ahead and use your Visa. My number is..."
